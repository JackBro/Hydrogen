√Update symbol table so it is more memory efficient and 
√Add a flag so the register values can be dumped successfully

-Preprocessor methods
-Add a plugin feature to easily add new operand methods
-Add scope to the variables in the table
can add more than 40 values
√Add a universal error method
-Add support for functions/methods
-Add support for other data types
-Add threads
-Add a scheduler
-Separate the parser into its own file
-Integrate debugging tools directly into the VM
-Design a portable libc for Hydrogen
-Currently Hydrogen is a high level VM and only functions as an interpreter. I would like to redesign it to work closer to the metal (have an operating system boot into Hydrogen; Make Hydrogen compile the bytecode and run it as machine code instead of just interpreting the bytecode)
